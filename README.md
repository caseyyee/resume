## What I do

I do many things, but if there was a role that describes me best, it would be a "UX Engineer". A UX Engineer fits somewhere at the precarious intersection of design and software engineering.

Mozilla, Google, Samsung, Oculus, W3C, EFF, Vimeo, Unity, Johnson & Johnson, Nike, McDonald’s, Nordstrom, Olympics 2010, NFB Interactive, BC Hydro, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver Film School, Cossette, Fjord, Blast Radius, Rennie, Concord Pacific, and Bosa Properties.
